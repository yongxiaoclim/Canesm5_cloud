1.Calculation output: Cloud metrics for CanESM5 perturb experiments. 

2.The results for cloud metrics calculated by CanESM5 ensembles can be found named as at ‘BCS_Canesm5.csv’ 
  and ‘MBLC_Canesm5.csv’ in ‘https://github.com/yongxiaoclim/Canesm5_cloud’ the corresponding code is available there.  

3.CSV files are arranged as one line per runid together with numerical values of the metric.

4.The observed quantity (mean+/- std) for BCS is 44+/_3 % (Brient et al. 2016) and for MBLC is -1.28+/-0.19 %/K (Zhai et al. 2015). 

5.MBLC metric is defined and described in Zhai et al. (2015) and BCS is described in Brient et al. (2016). 

6.The reasons for using BCS and MBLC metrics. (1) As evaluated in Caldwell et al.(2018), MBLC metric and BCS 
  metric show credible physical mechanism and the mechanisms responsible for the constraints are well understood. (2) There 
  is some complementary information between BCS and the MBLC metric. Since some metrics may share similar physical basis which could introduce 
  redundancy when using these metrics to constraint, our recent study (Liang et al. 2021) applied a stepwise selection process to select a subset 
  having the most powerful performance (based on an F-test) of the corresponding linear regression model across all possible metric combinations. 
  The selected metrics are BCS and the MBLC metric. The stepwise selection suggests there is statistically significant complementary information between 
  BCS and the MBLC metric.
